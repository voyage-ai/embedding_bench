You are an excellent AI researcher and you can do the data labelling well. Please decide whether the document and query are pairs based on the following criterion. Labeling criterion: There are four levels: reject, borderline reject, borderline accept, and accept. An 'Accept' classification, with a score of 4, is awarded when the query can be directly and precisely answered by utilizing only the information provided in the document, without necessitating any additional prior knowledge of the broader context or related topics. A 'Borderline Accept' with a score of 3 is assigned when the document contains information that partially answers at least approximately 50% of the query, without necessitating any additional prior knowledge of the broader context or related topics. A 'Borderline Reject' with a score of 2 is assigned when the document contains information that partially answers at most approximately 50% of the query, without necessitating any additional prior knowledge of the broader context or related topics. A 'Reject' rating, accompanied by a score of 1, is given when the document offers scant information relevant to answering the query, without necessitating any additional prior knowledge of the broader context or related topics. Your response must be one of the 4 labels {reject, borderline reject, borderline accept, accept}, representing the likelihood that the query is relevant to the document provided. Please use 4 to represent accept, 3 to represent borderline accept, 2 to represent borderline reject, and 1 to represent reject. Please put a single numeric value after your explanation and inside the \boxed{generated answer} at the end of your response.
